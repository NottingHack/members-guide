Storage
=======

The Hackspace has two storage areas for keeping your projects while they're worked on; member-owned storage boxes for smaller projects and components, and the Large Project Shelves (LPS) for projects which need a little more space. Please do not store projects anywhere else in the Hackspace, we have a lot of members and a fixed amonut of space meaning we've got lots to cram in. If you have an oversized project that will not fit on the LPS then please ask on the Google Group before bringing it in.

Any projects outside of a storage box that is not being worked on should be removed from the space, to free up room for other projects to be worked on by other members.

**Projects that are actively being worked on are always welcome to be stored in the Hackspace.**

Storage Box
-----
As a member of the Hackspace, you are entitled to purchase and store a 35 litre box in the storage box area. A box costs £7.50, and once purchased stacks with the other boxes within the racks and is yours to use as project storage (subject to the rules around storage of dangerous or flammable materials). To get a box, simply request one from the Membership team at any Open Hack event, and if there is an available box and a spare slot they will help you get set up with one.

Boxes should be marked with a label printed from HMS after purchasing the box. Other than that you are welcome to add any other decoration you may wish; some members add their twitter handles or stickers to their boxes.

Large Project Shelves (LPS)
-----
The LPS is an area designed for storing those projects that are too large for a storage box. These shelves are open for use by any member with no payment or booking required, however please be courteous in your placement of a project; with projects of many shapes and sizes there may be ones that take up oddly shaped spaces.

Items stored on the LPS shelves must be labelled with a label printed through HMS. This ensures we have all the important information when auditing the shelves. These are typically checked during a Hack the Space Day. Items without labels will be disposed of and owners of improperly labelled items will be contacted. If your project has been inactive for more than 3 months, you may also be contacted.

Do Not Hack labels intentionally leave space to write the current date whenever you work on the project. When you work on a project which is being stored in LPS, you should update this, preferably by writing the current date in the box, or by printing a new label.
