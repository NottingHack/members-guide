Pledge Drives
=============

From time to time, you may see pledge drives on the hackspace mailing list. Our tools wishlist is always much bigger than the Hackspace can afford outright for every purchase, pledges allow us to acquire things it might not under other circumstances.

Facilities at the Hackspace are directed by the interests of members. As the hackspace is a non-profit, we often do not have enough reserves to spend on new tools. The best way to demonstrate that a tool is wanted is for other members to pitch in, this is especially true where large, obscure, or expensive specialist tools are concerned.

Previous drives have included: a vending machine, an Xbox Kinect camera, a DIY CNC machine, donations to help Leeds Hackspace, bike parking, a lathe, and replacement parts for a knitting machine, the laser cutter, electronics test equipment, and 3D printers.

Starting a pledge drive is quite easy! Identify a desire for a tool, and make a new pledge drive page for it on the Wiki. You can see previous pledge drives, successful and defunct on our `Wiki Pledge Drive <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Category:Pledge_Drives>`_ category.
