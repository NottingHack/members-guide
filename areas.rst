Hackspace Rooms and Areas
===============

Comfy Area
----------

The comfy are is a place where people tend to congregate and socialise. With a projector, soft furnishings, coffee tables, and shelves full of books, it's an excellent place to relax.

A sound system and Raspberry Pi is available for use along with the projector.

The museum of oddities exists for us to showcase interesting items that we've collected over the years, from decades old consoles to an Amstrad phone. These items are not available for hacking, but if you've got something quirky you'd like to donate for display then feel free to let us know.

The library is available for reading while in the Hackspace, please feel free to make full use of it. We don't currently have a system for lending out books, but this is being worked on.

For more information about the Comfy Area see the wiki `Comfy Area <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Comfy_Area>`_, we also have a page for using the `AV setup <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Comfy_Area_AV>`_.

The Studio
----------

Our Studio contains many tables to work at, designed for projects that don’t require heavier tools or are 'clean' work such as prototyping, programming, craft, etc. At the back of the studio is a large cutting table available for use on cutting material or assembling overly large items. The studio is home to Snackspace and our main Large Project Storage shelving.

On the far wall there is a list of benefactors that made it possible for us to move into such a large space. 

Craft Room
----------

The craft room (also known as the Textiles Workshop) contains consumables for you to use, as well as specilised tools and equipment for crafty projects. This ranges from basics such as needles, threads, and fabric to kits for lace making, candle making, mosaic tiles, and more.

We are always happy to take suggestions of kits or improvements you’d like to see to the contents of the Craft Room, simply contact the Craft team to get involved.

The Blue room
-------------

The Blue Room is provided as a peaceful area where members can work if there is a large event going on in the main space, wish to work in a small group, or simply wish to work quietly on their laptop or one of the PCs open to use by members. In winter, it’s also one of the smaller areas of the Hackspace that can be heated more economically than the other rooms.

The Blue Room contains printers that are available for use by members, please consider a donation for large print runs to help towards the cost of toner and consumables. USB charging points are also available on the central table.

Electronics & 3D Printing Area
------------------------------

The electronics section is divided into three main benches - the soldering bench, the rework bench and the test bench. The test bench has a variety of test equipment,

* Various power supplies
* Rigol DS1102E oscilloscope (plus a couple of analogue scopes)
* Siglent SDG1062X arbitrary waveform generator
* Benchtop and handheld multimeters

There are also many drawers of components which you are welcome to use for testing circuits and making quick repairs. We do not maintain stocks of components so these are just various bits we have accumulated over the years.

The 3D printing section has a number of FDM printers and an Anycubic Photon SLA printer. There is a computer nearby for you to generate SLA files and copy things to a USB memory stick.
