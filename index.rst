Welcome to Nottingham Hackspace Members' Guide!
===============================================

Introduction
============

Welcome to Nottingham Hackspace, we hope you get a lot out of being a member. The Hackspace can be a bit daunting at first, so we’ve created this manual to tell you about many aspects of it. In particular; it’ll give you some idea of how the space is organised, what’s available within it, and some contacts and resources in case you have any further questions. 

You might feel a bit reticent as a new member, but it’s important to remember that you have as much right to use the space as anyone else, as well as a voice in the monthly Hackspace meetings. This manual should answer a lot of your questions, but if there’s anything else please email membership@nottinghack.org.uk
