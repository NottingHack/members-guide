The Hackspace Online
====================

Nottingham Hackspace maintains a wide online presence, with sites ranging from our social media and mailing list to our wiki and internal tools like HMS. Our online presence is one of the main ways we attract new members, communicate with existing ones, and promote our events and workshops. If you're able to help promote us from time to time whether by retweet, share or like, it is a big help toward attracting new people.

We welcome contributions to all these sites; if you'd like to get involved with any please contact the relevant team, who's details can be found in Section 1.3 - Hackspace Organisation.

Websites
--------

Main website - www.nottinghack.org.uk
`````````````````````````````````````
This is our main public-facing site; where events, workshops and links to other online resources are available. 

The website is managed by our Comms team.

Hackspace Management System (HMS) - hms.nottinghack.org.uk/
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
HMS was developed by Hackspace members to organise and manage our ever-increasing group. Every Hackspace member registers an account on HMS as part of their signup, allowing them to view their Snackspace balance, book time on tools, see our door access codes, and update their contact details when they change. HMS is also use to manage member project and print approved Do Not Hack labels.

To log in, please click the link titled: “Already a member? Login”, then enter your username and password.

HMS is managed by the Software team.

Wiki - wiki.nottinghack.org.uk
``````````````````````````````
The Nottinghack Wiki is where we store information around projects and equipment, as well as organisation details for big events such as Makerfaire and EMF. As a member please feel free to start a user page to hold build logs of your projects, or when you're collaborating with other members on projects and need a place to store information.

You can use your HMS account details to log into the wiki and make edits.

Planet Nottinghack - planet.nottinghack.org.uk
``````````````````````````````````````````````
If you blog about Hackspace relevant stuff, projects you've made here or the subject of making and hacking as a whole, you’d be most welcome to contribute your feed to Planet Nottinghack. Many members run their own blogs, and Planet Nottinghack uses RSS to collect them all into one place.  If you would like to be included on this, please open a pull request against the GitHub repository.  If you’re not sure how to do this then ask on the Google Group.

Other forms of interaction
--------------------------

Google Group - groups.google.com/group/nottinghack
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
The main place for discussion outside of the Hackspace itself is our Google Group mailing list, which is open to contributions from anyone. Please be aware that the mailing list is 

Facebook - www.facebook.com/nottinghack
```````````````````````````````````````
Our Facebook page is one of the main ways we promote ourselves to potential new members, whether by sharing photos and videos of events or telling the world about our next big project.

Twitter - @HSNotts
``````````````````
Our Twitter account works in a similar way to our Facebook page, only with 140 characters or less. We'll often tweet while at external events, with pictures of members representing Nottinghack or projects we've taken to demonstrate.

Flickr - www.flickr.com/groups/nottinghack/
```````````````````````````````````````````
The Nottinghack account on Flickr contains all the photos that are automatically uploaded from the Hackspace camera.  You can normally find this hanging from a hook on the wall next to the giant “H” in the studio - please take pictures of the project you are working on!

If you are already a member of Flickr, you can contribute photos to the Nottinghack Group as well.
