Teams
-----
The day-to-day running of the Hackspace is done by every one of our members. Even quick and simple things like tidying up or putting tools back into their proper storage are a great help.

More specific activites are managed by teams within the Hackspace, a list of which can be found below. Please remember the Hackspace is a community and not a service; we can't guarantee tool uptime or material availability. The teams are all members like yourself, who volunteer their time to help make the space better.
