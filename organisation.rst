Hackspace Organisation and Teams
======================

Nottingham Hackspace is registered as a non-profit limited company (Reg. No. 07766826). Surplus after rent and other expenses are used for tools, consumables, and Hackspace improvements (such as infrastructure and refurbishment work).

An elected Board of Trustees comprised of seven people oversee Nottingham Hackspace; ensuring financial sustainability and managing critical issues. All of the board are volunteers, Nottinghack does not have any paid employees or membership tiers. **Members' meetings are held in the Hackspace at 20:00, on the first Wednesday of each month.** These meetings, and votes conducted at the meetings, are open to all members. 

Please find details of the board members here: http://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Board. Board elections take place each May, any member can stand for election.

Teams
-----
The day-to-day running of the Hackspace is done by every one of our members. Even quick and simple things like tidying up or putting tools back into their proper storage are a great help.

More specific activites are managed by teams within the Hackspace, a list of which can be found below. Please remember the Hackspace is a community and not a service; we can't guarantee tool uptime or material availability. The teams are all members like yourself, who volunteer their time to help make the space better.

Want to get involved in a team? Drop them an email, ask them when they're in the space or join them on Slack by registering here: http://slack.nottinghack.org.uk/ (Slack is like a set of web based IRC channels accompanied by mobile apps.)
