Questions
=========

If you have any questions or requests, the best places to ask are the public group forum (unless your question involves confidential stuff), the IRC channel, or in person at the Open Hack night, which is every Wednesday from 18:30.

Membership enquiries and handled through the membership team: membership@nottinghack.org.uk. If there’s anything you can’t get answered on the public google group, just get in touch.

If you need to discuss something in private, or have a complaint, please contact the trustees at trustees@nottinghack.org.uk.

We’d like to emphasise that the hackspace is your space as much as it’s everyone else’s. Just like every other member, you’re paying a share of the running costs. We strongly encourage you to get to know other members, ask questions & talk a bit about your own projects. We look forward to seeing you at the space more!
