Questions
=========

If you have any questions or requests, the best places to ask are the public Google Group (unless your question involves confidential stuff), Slack (if it's a question for a specific team), or in person at the Open Hack night, which is every Wednesday from 18:30.

Membership enquiries and handled through the membership team: membership@nottinghack.org.uk. If there’s anything you can’t get answered on the public Google Group, just get in touch.

If you need to discuss something in private, or have a complaint, please contact the trustees at trustees@nottinghack.org.uk.

We’d like to emphasise that the hackspace is your space as much as it’s everyone else’s. Just like every other member, you’re paying a share of the running costs. We strongly encourage you to get to know other members, ask questions & talk a bit about your own projects. We look forward to seeing you at the space more!
