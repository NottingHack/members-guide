Guests
======

Outside of Open Hack events guests are welcome at Nottingham Hackspace when accompanied by a member. As the Hackspace contains dangerous tools as well as tools which require induction guests should not be unattended while within the Hackspace; at the minimum a guest should be in the same room as the member hosting them. It’s expected that if they’re using the space and any consumables or facilities within it, they or the member that invited them makes an appropriate donation. Guest wifi is available, the password is on a notice in the comfy area and can be found in HMS.

From time to time we do get people ringing the doorbell of the Hackspace outside of Open Hack events; if they cannot prove they are a member, or you do not wish to host them as your guest, do not let them into the Hackspace.

**Please do not give out the wifi password or door codes to people who are not Hackspace members.**
