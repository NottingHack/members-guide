The Studio
==========

Our Studio contains many tables to work at, designed for projects that donâ€™t require heavier tools or are 'clean' work such as prototyping, programming, craft, etc. At the back of the studio is a large cutting table available for use on cutting material or assembling overly large items. The studio is also currently home to the 3D printer, Snackspace, and several sewing machines of various types. 

On the far wall there is a list of benefactors that made it possible for us to move into such a large space. On this wall you can also find the Hackspace camera - please use this to take pictures of your project! The camera automatically uploads to the Nottinghack Flickr account, so please ask permission of anyone who would be in the photo as necessary.
