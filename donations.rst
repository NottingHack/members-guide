Donations
=========

No one is obliged to make any extra monetary contribution above their membership payment, however we do accept donations.

Monetary donations
------------------
If you would like to make a monetary donation, simply place it in one of the donation pots throughout the Hackspace. Donations can also be made using a payment form on HMS.

Equipment donations
-------------------
We only have limited space so at present the general rule is NOT to accept donations of old or obsolete equipment.

We are interested in donations of good-quality components, tools and test equipment. The best way to see if the Hackspace would like a donation of equipment is to make a list, and take photographs, then email these to the `Google Group <https://groups.google.com/g/nottinghack/>`_, or post on `Discord <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Discord>`_ if you are already a member.

Please do NOT bring donations to the space without asking on the `Google Group <https://groups.google.com/g/nottinghack/>`_ or `Discord <https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Discord>`_ first. There should be no assumption that donations will be accepted. If the donation is not accepted, please respect the decision.
