Children and Pets
=================

Children are welcome at Nottinghack, however be aware that it is primarily an adult environment. While it is unlikely that there would be content overtly unsuitable for children, members may not be watching their language or could be discussing adult topics. In addition to this; the Hackspace has potentially dangerous tools and chemicals which are not locked away, and no specific child-proofing measures in place.

Pets are also welcome in the space! They must be supervised and shouldn't be anywhere loud or dangerous. Make sure your pet is under control and comfortable around strangers.

**Under-16s, and 16-18 year olds must be accompanied by an adult**, and are generally expected to be engaged with the space in some way (such as working on a project). Periodically we have events specifically for children of all ages.
