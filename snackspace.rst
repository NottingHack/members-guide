Snackspace
==========

There are vending machines for snacks and drinks, which accept coins or your RFID membership card. Snackspace credit is also used for tools which incur a cost, such as the laser cutter and embroidery machine.

Your snackspace account can be topped up through HMS after logging in. This credit does not expire and is not refundable.

If there’s something you’d like to see in snackspace, please contact the Snackspace team to make a suggestion.
